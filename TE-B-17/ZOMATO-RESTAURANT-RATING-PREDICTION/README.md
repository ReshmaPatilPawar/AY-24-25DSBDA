üçΩÔ∏è Zomato Restaurant Rating Prediction


"Eat well, Predict well, Live well!" ‚ú®

Zomato Restaurant Rating Prediction is an end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts restaurant ratings based on features like restaurant type, location, cuisines, cost for two, and more. The project is built using Python for data processing and machine learning, Flask for backend development, and HTML/CSS for the frontend, offering a smooth user experience and real-time rating predictions.

The machine learning model used is a  Extra Tree Regressor, trained after thorough data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, label encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling. Evaluation metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix ensure the model‚Äôs reliability. The final trained model is saved using joblib and integrated into a Flask application to serve predictions.

The web interface is simple and user-friendly, allowing users to input restaurant details and receive instant rating predictions. Screenshots of the prediction output are included ![Screenshot 2025-04-26 195042](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f31a33ed-8691-4a5e-babd-ccc153497465)

 to showcase the frontend design and functionality.

Technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Flask, Matplotlib, Seaborn, HTML5, and CSS3. The application is hosted locally on http://127.0.0.1:5000/, ensuring smooth and fast access during development.

This project perfectly demonstrates the integration of Machine Learning with Web Development, covering data analysis, model building, API development, and frontend design in a seamless flow. It is an ideal portfolio project for showcasing practical skills in both AI/ML and full-stack development.

Future improvements include deploying the app on cloud platforms like Render or AWS, enhancing UI with frameworks like Bootstrap, adding authentication systems, and expanding into restaurant recommendation features.
